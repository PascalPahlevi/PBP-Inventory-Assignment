# Assignment 7

## What are the main differences between stateless and stateful widget in Flutter?
In Flutter, widgets can be categorized into two, those being stateless and stateful widgets. Some of the main differences between them are:
1. Stateful widgets allow users to change their internal state while on the other hand stateless widgets do not.
2. Stateful widgets require a separate 'state' class in order to manage their mutable state.
3. Stateless widgets are much simpler and lightweight compared to stateful widgets as they do not need to maintain state.
4. Stateless widgets do not depened on internal state changes when rendering hence making them more efficient.

## Explain all widgets that you used in this assignment.
1. Scaffold : Provides the basic structure of the app.
2. AppBar : Displays a bar on top of the screen that contains the app's title.
3. SingleChildScrollView: Provides a scrolling  functionality for other widgets, if in any case they do not fit on the screen.
4. Text: A widget used to display text on the screen that displays the app's title.
5. Padding: Adds padding to the column widget.
6. Column: Displays the contents in a vertical arrangement.
7. GridView.count: A grid with a fixed number of columns that displays the 'ShopCard' widgets in a grid.
8. Material: Provides a rectangular area with a material design background.
9. InkWell: A widget that provides a touch response.
10. Icon: Displays an icon.
